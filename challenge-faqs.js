              Challenge Lived by Absolute Aid SEEKING TO LIVE A DO’ERS LIFESTYLE
              At Absolute Aid™ we live by one motto, and it’s not surprising
              that it’s the slogan of our very company, "Seek To Do More”. In a
              world that tells us to "quit if it’s hard" we aim to shatter that
              mindset, because we believe people are capable of accomplishing
              and doing great things when they make the choice to go after a
              goal, and follow-up that choice with action and effort. At
              Absolute Aid™ we provide physical and mental aid to empower those
              who seek to do more. Our desire is to aid people in all of their
              life’s pursuits as they seek to become the very best they can be
              whether that’s at the gym, on the field, in the outdoors, with
              your family, at work, or anywhere life takes you. Oftentimes that
              means stretching ourselves just outside of our comfort zones in
              the name of growth, seeking to do just a little more to improve 1%
              at a time, day after day. We believe the three core components for
              change are: 1.) Choice- Make the choice that you want to seek
              change or seek a goal 2.) Action- Create an actionable
              step-by-step game plan to get you to that final goal 3.) Effort-
              This requires no skill. This is where you see what you’re made of
              and this is where growth happens. The team at Absolute Aid™ has
              employed the core foundations outlined in this challenge within
              our own personal lives with great success and we decided to share
              this same self-created challenge with others. We have seen how
              these elements can improve our own lives and we seek to offer this
              challenge to anyone around us who seeks to do more and chooses to
              always move forward. No fees, no strings attached, no sales
              gimmick, we just want to see others around us become the
              unstoppable Do’ers that we know they’re capable of becoming when
              they make a choice and follow up that choice with action and
              effort. THE CHALLENGE Once you have made the choice to seek a
              change, and to become a Do’er, next comes the action part of the
              equation, the plan to get you there. This challenge will build a
              strong foundation within you moving forward in life. The 6
              Elements: 1.) Physical: 2.) Diet/Water: 3.) Spiritual: 4.)
              Reading: 5.) Education: 6.) Social Media: 7.) Practice??? These
              are the different elements that make up the foundation of this
              challenge and it’s very simple. We linearly work up to employ all
              of these foundations over time on a daily basis to create new
              habits that will undoubtedly benefit your life physically and
              mentally. Some foundations will be easier for some and harder for
              others but we are all different and we have different strengths
              and weaknesses and these foundations, when the effort is put in,
              will positively benefit our lives. The 6 Elements: 1.) Physical:
              Do something physical every, single day. Seven days a week. Yup.
              Now this doesn’t mean hard training seven days a week; there’s a
              difference between “train seven days a week” and “do something
              physical seven days a week". You may train heavy in the gym some
              days, then go for a light one-mile walk/jog another day, or play
              pick-up basketball for an hour with your friends, or go for a
              hike. Just get out and move. Try to break a sweat every day.
              Anything is better than nothing, and over time even those little
              10-minute bodyweight workouts you squeezed in will add up. Don’t
              believe me? Stop reading this challenge, stand-up, and jump
              up-and-down for the next 3 minutes straight and tell me how hard
              your heart is beating after just jumping up and down in one place
              for a few minutes. Trust me, a lot of work can be accomplished in
              a short period of time and when time is hard to find, anything is
              better than nothing. Remember we’re looking long term here and
              over time those little workouts add up long term. Check out our
              FREE WORKOUT PROGRAMS if you’re looking for help. 2.) Diet/Water:
              Stick to a diet (of your choice) and drink a gallon of water a
              day. That’s it. Simple. It’s not always easy, but it’s simple.
              When in doubt, here’s a way to keep it very, very simple- meat,
              vegetables, potatoes, rice, eggs, nuts. If it isn’t one of those
              six items- skip it. You can also eat as much meat and vegetables
              as your heart desires. Over time, I’m very confident you’ll see
              why it works. If you need help with picking the right diet for you
              talk with our own NUTRITION COACH 3.) Spiritual: We employ this
              element within our own lives as we set time aside daily for bible
              reading and prayer. If this is not your style, then we encourage
              you to just take this time for self-reflection/meditation. Take
              10-15 minutes a day with no distractions, no screens, and just
              soak in the quietness (and the world) around you sitting on a
              porch with a rocking chair, going for a walk, or just spending
              time sitting outdoors will do wonders. 4.) Reading: In a world of
              screens, where our brains have become used to constant scrolling,
              skimming, and blue light, it’s time to put the screens away for
              this portion of your day and read a tangible book…with real pages.
              Aim to read at least 5 pages a day (and of course, oftentimes
              those 5 pages will turn into many more pages). So put the screens
              away and pick up any book of your choice. 5.) Education: This is
              the fun part of the challenge. We should always be seeking to
              learn more. Every single day of our lives we should seek to
              further our education. So this portion of the challenge is simple-
              set at least 15 minutes aside to learn something new on purpose.
              This could be from reading a different book or a magazine, going
              down the google rabbit hole, attending “Youtube University” and
              watching videos on a subject you want to know more about, or even
              dedicated time to taking on of the millions of online courses
              available all over the internet to increase your knowledge on
              something. This is designed to be fun and not feel like work, so
              keep it that way. Maybe one day you’re watching youtube videos to
              learn how to change your car’s oil, and the next day you’re
              reading about the War of 1812, only to read chapter 1 of a
              wilderness survival guide the following day. Building this habit
              or learning new things daily will have a massive long term impact.
              Have fun and always be seeking to learn more. 6.) Hobby: Set 20
              minutes aside every day to dedicate to a hobby that brings you
              joy. We shouldn't forget about this element of life as we seek to
              become a well rounded person. Seeking joy daily, and continuing to
              do the things that make us unique, is important. Maybe it’s
              playing the guitar, maybe it’s archery, maybe it’s knitting some
              gloves, maybe you want to pick up a new skill/hobby which will
              require that awkward learning process (hello harmonica, nice to
              see you old friend). Great, seek out joy and dedicate time daily
              to a hobby you enjoy or want to take up. HOW TO GET STARTED Step
